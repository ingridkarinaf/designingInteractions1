# Food for Thought
Mini project 1 as a part of the course Designing Interactions at ITU.

### A "food-diary" tracking the experience in a more qualitative way. 

Food for Thought is a relfective eating diary beyond contemporary self-tracking apps that primarily focuses on nutrition consumed (calories, fat, fiber, protein) and activity (steps, distance run, weight lifted, length and quality of sleep). Instead, Food for Thought aims to look beyond such numbers, and instead track the experience of each meal the user consumes. In other words, this artifact aims to track qualitative data on the following spectrums: taste, ingredients, amount, context, occasion, aesthethics.

While the metrics are somewhat arbitrary in that they could easily be replaced by other measurements that capture the experience of a meal, they allow the user to track their meals in a completely subjective way by using the entire spectrum of colours and the non-directional shape circle as opposed to specific colours signifying good and bad (such as green and red) or a bar signifying a range that could indicate more or less.

The output is a circle containing ambigious colours that the user may reflect back on, capturing their subjective experience that is near impossible to compare to anyone else, or even themselves from a certain period of time to another.
